Inspired by [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com/)'s excellent book, [Show Your Work!](http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/), I am going to start sharing my work. I'm not going to publish a static portfolio of work, that would put too much emphasis on the finished projects. It is not my intention to mould pristine works of genius before publishing them, if I tried that nothing would emerge. Besides, there are very few projects that have not made me cringe to some degree when revisiting them even months later. I take that as a good sign, it shows me that I have advanced my knowledge and understanding in the intervening period, but it also means that these projects are never really *done*. There are always elements that can be improved. These projects can be an ongoing undertaking or a temporary vehicle for learning, abandoned when their purpose has been served.

Little and often
-------
I don't want to spend weeks or months toiling behind the scenes before unveiling big new ideas or designs. I would rather show you how I got there, I will take you behind the scenes to show you the process that I follow, documenting what I do, opening up my experiments and ideas, building on the work of others. It will be messy, there will be mistakes, bad decisions and loose ends. I want to bring you in on the process, to share success and failure, excitement and despair, insight and confusion.

Simple side projects that don't matter
-------
I will share my side projects. They will be fun, simple and [not taken too seriously](http://firstround.com/article/Spotifys-Design-Lead-on-Why-Side-Projects-Should-be-Stupid). The primary goal is to have fun while learning, what I share will be done so as an enthusiast. I will take chances and experiment, change my mind and cut corners. In sharing my work I hope that it is of use or interest to someone. This is not about self promotion or stroking my ego. I will be publishing things that I think will be helpful or interesting to others.
