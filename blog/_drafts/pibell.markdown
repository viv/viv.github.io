Circuit diagram & description. 10k resistor fine for small test circuit but with longer run of telephone cable supplied too much resistance. A 5k resistor solved that although does sometimes give false positives. TV / electronic interference.


Button housing

Creation: Cutting & drilling. Experimenting with shapes. Figuring out how to mount to door frame. Fitting.


Software
-------
